      <p>
        CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a useful stylesheet language used to define the visual appearance of a web page. It connects with HTML to alter how content is displayed, allowing developers, and you!, to style elements like fonts, colors, spacing and layout. Without CSS, websites would appear as plain, unstyled documents.

      </figure>
      <p>One of the core strengths of CSS is its ability to separate content from design. By keeping styling rules in a separate file, developers can easily maintain and update the look of a site without changing its structure or content. This makes the process of web development more efficient and scalable. CSS also provides a level of control that enables designers to create visually engaging experiences. From simple color changes to complex animations and responsive layouts, CSS plays a critical role in how users perceive and interact with web pages today.</p><br><br>

      <h2 id="why_use">Why use CSS?</h2>
      <p>
        Using CSS offers many benefits that make it essential in modern web development. One of the main reasons is consistency. By defining styles in a single stylesheet, you can apply the same design rules across multiple pages, ensuring that your website looks uniform and professional. <br><br>
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS also reduces the amount of code duplication, which makes development faster and easier to maintain. Instead of styling each HTML element individually, you can apply styles globally, saving time and reducing the chance of errors. <br><br> Another key advantage is adaptability. With CSS, it’s easier to create websites that work on various screen sizes and devices. Techniques like media queries allow you to customize the layout for mobile phones, tablets, and desktops, enhancing the user experience across all platforms. <br><br>

      <h2 id="basics">The Basics</h2>
      <p>
        CSS works by using rules that target HTML elements and apply specific styles to them. Each rule consists of a selector, which identifies the element to be styled, and a declaration block that contains one or more style declarations.<br> Each declaration includes a property and a value, such as <code class="home-code"> color: blue;</code> or <code class="home-code">font-size: 16px;</code>.<br><br> There are three main ways to include CSS in a website: inline styles, internal styles, and external stylesheets. Inline styles apply directly to individual HTML elements and are generally used for quick, one-off changes. Internal styles are placed in a <code class="home-code">&lt;style&gt;</code> block within the HTML document’s <code class="home-code">&lt;head&gt;</code> section and are useful for smaller projects or individual pages.<br><br> External stylesheets are the most scalable and commonly used method.<br> These are separate <code class="home-code">.css</code> files linked to the HTML document using a <code class="home-code">&lt;link&gt;</code> tag. This approach is preferred for larger websites, as it promotes organization and reusability, making it easier to maintain and update styles over time.
