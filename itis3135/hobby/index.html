                    For my midterm Hobby project I have chosen to focus on fashion as the topic as it is the hobby I am most invested in. Fashion as a concept is something we interact with every single day whether we chose too or not and I personally believe that the way someone chooses to present themselves can say a lot about them.

                    Fashion and clothing in general is one of the oldest human creative outlets, since ancient times many human beings have sought new ways to express themselves through their outfits. Fashion is a hobby for me in more than one way, it is something that I and everyone else actively participate in everyday just by getting dressed. It is also a hobby to me because I am invested in it's news cycle and updates.

                        I was first introduced to fashion as a hobby in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The music I was listening to at the time made numerous references to fashion brands such as Number (N)ine and Rick Owens. While those comapnies are less of an interest to me they helped work as a gateway to me getting interested in fashion as a hobby. As of recent the brands I am personally most interested in are Dior Homme, Saint Laurent Paris, Celine, Dolce and Gabanna's D&G difusion line and Acne Studios.

                        Most companies release runway collections on a seasonal schedule. The most common schedule is twice a year with a Fall/Winter season and a Spring/Summer season. Two of my personal favorite runway seasons are Dior Homme Fall/Winter 2005 and Saint Laurent Paris Fall/Winter 2015. I have chosen two pieces of clothing from my collection to highlight these seasons.

                    Fashion is everywhere around us in our daily lives regardless of how aware we are of it. Everyday everyone makes a choice of what to wear often most centered around where they will be going. Someone going to work at their office job is going to dress very differently than someone going to the skate park.

                    Fashion is something everyone participates in daily, however most people would not consider it a hobby of theirs. In my opinion for fashion to become a hobby for someone they have to be more interested than the average person who mostly just wears clothes for utility purposes.

                        There are a number of ways to make fashion into a real hobby. The most clear way to me is having a collection of clothes which you have purchased primarily because of how they look. Another way that fashion can become a hobby is through fashion media consumption such as watching runway shows or reading fashion magazines.

                    Humans have been making clothes for over a hundred thousand years. For nearly all of this time humans have not been able to afford the luxury that is a large, creative closet. Fashion is an easy and fun way to express oneself and I believe it is important to take advantage of this luxury that most people in history and many today still are not afforded.

                        Inventions like clothing are the reason humans have been able to accomplish what they have and I believe the long chronicled history of fashion can be very interesting even to people who do not care much about the topic today.
